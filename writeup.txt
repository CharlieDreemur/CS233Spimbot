# Strategy
## move
We write a move function to move easily when we convey arguments velocity, x position, y position to it / 
it will compare the position of bot with the target position to determine whether to move

## Route
We start by storing water at the beginning and then climb along the ladder to a higher position on our side. /
After that jump down the ladder diagonally so that we can clean more tiles. /

## Solve Puzzle
We use a normal n queen approach to solve puzzle and wrapper it as a function that we can call / 
We also has a loop_solve_puzzle function that helps us solve the puzzle for multipe times to save enough water /

## Solve Puzzle Optimaziton
We replaced the place_queen_step given in the documentation with the algorithm in Lab7 /
The ability of the bot to solve the puzzle is improved to a certain extent, enabling it to solve the puzzle more quickly and obtain water. /

## Water Control
We turn off POWERWASH before solving puzzle to save water, and only open it when we deciding to move /

## Final step
We developed an algorithm through delicate calculations and repeated experiments. /
This algorithm controls the bot to solve as many puzzles as possible before the end of the game, store water, and leave enough time for the final jump./
In this way, we can maximize our score. /
